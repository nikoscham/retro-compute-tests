# retro-compute-tests
A collection of computational test programs designed for retro computing systems, focusing on old operating systems like Windows 9x (95/98/Me), DOS, and early Windows NT. 
This repository features performance-intensive codes, such as finite element solvers, matrix operations, and numerical simulations, written in languages like Fortran 77 to match the capabilities of vintage hardware and compilers (e.g., Microsoft Fortran PowerStation 4.0).
